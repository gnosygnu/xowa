      I'm skipping the release again. There were two minor changes, but neither seem to be enough to warrant another version.

      I did release Russian wikis this week. See: <a href="https://archive.org/details/Xowa_ruwiki_latest" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/details/Xowa_ruwiki_latest</a>

      I've spent a lot of time this week on the new Android version. I've actually reached a point this weekend wherein it is working with English Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 3.1.1, I'm going to try to release this new Alpha with for Simple Wikipedia. My aim is to get a release of English Wikipedia shortly afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      For wikis, I'll try to do a refresh of French Wikipedia.

      I'm skipping the release this week as well. I've spent the week working on the new Android dump format for gallery, as well as a new database merge feature. I haven't found anything worth a release.

    <p>
      I posted the English image updates at <a href="https://archive.org/details/Xowa_enwiki_latest" rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber">[1]</a> I'm working on Russian now, and they'll be ready next week.

    <p>
      These fixes addressed the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Poems with references would show duplicate references at the bottom of the page. In addition, the text of the references may be incorrectly placed in the body of the poem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Image maps with scribunto code relying on the page title generated script errors.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_parser_fixes_including_mapsource_extension">Minor parser fixes including mapsource extension</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      These fixes are several, but the following are notable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Scribunto code calling json-decode was failing if the code was relying on integer keys. For example, {"1"="a"} needs to parse <code>1</code> as an integer, not a string. Otherwise, code calling <code>ipairs</code> would later fail
      </li>
      <li>
        Mapsource functions such as {{#deg2dd}} would not handle non-ASCII double apostrophes. For example, <code>’’</code> needs to go to <code>''</code> and then to <code>"</code>. XOWA was doing the 1st part (<code>''</code>) but not the second (<code>"</code>)
      </li>
    </ul>

      I spent a good deal of time working on most of these minor fixes, so my progress on Android was limited. However, I did get a text version of Simple Wikipedia working with the new dump and the new UI. I'm planning to work on images this week, and hope to have a new beta for v2.12.2
    </p>
    <p>
      For wikis, I'm generating English now. I'll try to add Arabic this week as well.

      This week will be another skipped release. I've only made very minor changes this week, so it didn't seem worth it to make a new release.

      I did post wikis for Dutch and Latin at <a href="https://archive.org/details/Xowa_nlwiki_latest" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/details/Xowa_nlwiki_latest</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/Xowa_lawiki_latest" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/details/Xowa_lawiki_latest</a>

    <p>
      v2.11.4 is a minor release. It has one fix affecting French Wikipedia pages, and another for the simple-mode Category system.

    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_">Fix for "long-vertical scrolling" on French Wikipedia</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      In v2.11.2, I added a fix to handle extraneous pre sections: see <a href="#Fix_for_extraneous_pre-sections_in_References" id="xolnki_2">#Fix for extraneous pre-sections in References</a>. It turned out this fix was not correct, and caused pages in French Wikipedia to have large scrolling sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reverted the fix for v2.11.4. As it turned out, the issue with extraneous pre sections was handled by the underlying templates themselves.

    <p>
      XOWA generates a simple Category system when it builds a wiki (this is called v1). If you want an authentic version of the Category system (this is called v2), you can always import it separately under <a href="/wiki/Dashboard/Import/Offline" id="xolnki_3" title="Dashboard/Import/Offline">Import offline</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple Category system looks like it broke some time ago during the general database redesign from .sqlite3 to .xowa. I fixed it for this release.

    <p>
      I fixed the one minor Wikibase issue, but am deferring a few other possible issues till later. I'm still chugging away on the HTML dump. My aim is to get a simple wiki dump for the next release.
    </p>
    <p>
      I generated the English Wiki dump but there were only about 3 thousand new images, and I didn't feel that it merited an update. For wikis, I'm going to update French, and then go through as many as I can of Lithuanian, Limburgish, Estonian, Latvian and Nynorsk.
    </p>

      v2.11.2 is a significant release. It addresses minor, but noticeable issues with gallery sections, location maps, and references. It also has some Wikibase fixes.

      Wikimedia added a change a few weeks ago to force &lt;gallery&gt; tags to use a css. See <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T110709" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T110709</a> This resulted in galleries being shown vertically, instead of horizontally.

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_Location_maps_not_working_on_non-English_wikis">Fix for Location maps not working on non-English wikis</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This has been a bug for a few months, but I had misdiagnosed it as bad Module code. Basically, non-English wikis would copy-paste the same Module:Location_map code in to their wikis. This failed to work in XOWA, because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Module code has a hard-coded reference to <code>Template</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        XOWA actually generates the non-English name for Template for the wiki. For Croatian Wikipedia, this is <code>Šablon</code> not <code>Template</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This basically broke location maps in non-English wikis. I should have caught this earlier, but the first few I looked at were all bad usages (no location coordinates passed).
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.11.2 now uses the canonical name just like MediaWiki.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_extraneous_pre-sections_in_References">Fix for extraneous pre-sections in References</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think this is also a recent bug, but I can't track down the actual cause. MediaWiki has inconsistent logic for trimming whitespace around template and link arguments. The one at issue was a piece of code like <code>{{TemplateName| B\n }}</code>. On my local version of MediaWiki (1.25.2), it doesn't trim the <code>"\n "</code> after the B and creates a &lt;pre&gt; section. However, on Wikipedia, it does trim the whitespace and does not create a &lt;pre&gt; section.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this behavior changed recently, but couldn't find the actual line of code in MediaWiki. For now, XOWA will automatically trim end whitespace for all template arguments. In my opinion this is more intuitive behavior anyway.

      These are a handful of signficant fixes that only affect some several dozen pages. They are in brief:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        in Lua code, entity.formatPropertyValues('P123') would not work. Note that entity.formatPropertyValues('property_name') did work
      </li>
      <li>
        Lua code expects a "datatype" property on entity and a value of "globe-coordinate".
      </li>
      <li>
        Lua code required actual numbers for quantity ("99"), not the literal Wikidata value ("+99")
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_fixes_for_Redirect">Minor fixes for Redirect</span>

    <p>
      These are two minor items worth more explanation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Redirects would not work if they had an argument. For example, #REDIRECT [[Target_page|link=collapsed]]
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on "Redirected from" links at the top of the page would not work. For example, try <a href="/site/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK</a> and click on "Redirected from UK"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>

    <p>
      This was actually not working from the start. Basically tidy needs to take something like ...
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;a&lt;/div&gt;a1&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;b&lt;/div&gt;b1
</pre>

</pre>
    <p>
      This has a noticeable visual effect for some wikis (Croatian Wiktionary) which have HTML like the above.
    </p>
    <p>
      I modified the jtidy_xowa.jar to handle this behavior.

      XOWA was showing broken references on 2.6 millions pages for the 2015-10 English Wikipedia dump. This was due to some recent changes in <a href="/site/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module:Citation/CS1">Module:Citation/CS1</a>. Specifically, the number of local variables in the citation0 function was greater than the default 200 limit for Luaj.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Serbian languages now have language dropdowns. For example, sr.wikipedia.org now allows you to switch between Cyrillic and Latin variants
      </li>
      <li>
        Chinese and Serbian wikis now fully implement the "-{}-" syntax. This includes some significant functions like recursive conversion, word-interchangeability, and adhoc rule-definition. See: <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Writing_systems/Syntax" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Writing_systems/Syntax</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'm really hoping that the new functionality matches MediaWiki. If you're a Chinese / Serbian user, please take a moment to spot-check a few pages and let me know if there is anything amiss.

      MediaWiki recently changed the &lt;syntaxhighlight&gt; extension away from geshi to Pygments. In the process, it looks like they changed a few of the general parsing rules as well. v2.10.4 has better support for these blocks, though actual syntax coloring is still some time away.

      v2.9.3 is another light release. It has a few fixes for Chinese wikis.

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Handle_new_relative_urls_for_CSS">Handle new relative urls for CSS</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Wikimedia changed their url format for CSS resources this week. Previously it used to be "//simple.wikipedia.org/w/...". Now it is just "/w/..." Unfortunately, since XOWA didn't handle relative-style urls, the CSS files weren't being downloaded for new wikis. This is fixed now.

    </h3>
    <p>
      After building the images for the Chinese wikis, I noticed that there were issues with blank message boxes and blank reference text. It turned out that these were broken by the language dropdown back in v2.8.1. I spent a good deal of time fixing these issues, but realized that the current implementation of variant handling (-{zh-hans:text}-) needs to be rewritten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current version is much better than the last version, but there are still some changes that need to be done.

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_source_code_reorganization">Minor source code reorganization</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I spent a good deal of time reorganizing the main XOWA project codebase. In particular, XOWA had a lot of extra "Source Folders" in addition to "src". These folders arose from the C# to Java conversion and C# having a broader scope for a non-public class than Java (in C#, non-public classes can be seen by classes across namespaces).
    </p>
    <p>
      Source code cleanup is an ongoing process, but this should make a substantial difference.

See <a href="/wiki/App/Import/English_Wikipedia#File_databases:_v1,_v2a_and_v2b" id="xolnki_9" title="App/Import/English Wikipedia">App/Import/English_Wikipedia#File databases: v1, v2a and v2b</a>

    </h3>
    <p>
      v2.8.3 has a number of application startup changes. The most noticeable one is a splash animation to show that XOWA is launching after you double-clicked the exe (or ran the sh).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I added a "fatal error" window to give more information if XOWA fails to run because of SWT or XULRunner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I rebuilt xowa.exe with launch4j. Also, both exe's now support a standalone JRE. If you place a JRE in /xowa/bin/windows/java/jre , it will run on systems without java installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, these changes aren't uniform across all operating systems.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Windows: All of the above apply
      </li>
      <li>
        Linux: Only the first 2 apply. A standalone JRE will probably not happen due to the many varieties of Linux distros as well as the general Linux philosophy of a central package manager
      </li>
      <li>
        Mac OS X: None apply. I had problems with the splash and the error window, whereas I haven't looked at the standalone JRE. I'll work on these for a future release, though it's difficult to say when.
      </li>

    <p>
      When v0.0.0 was first released, XOWA used text files for all its wikis. XOWA has since moved to sqlite3 databases in v0.7.1 but the home wiki still remained in the text file format.
    </p>
    <p>
      With v2.8.3, the home wiki now is in a sqlite3 format. This should be the start of a number of changes, including better namespaces (everything is in the Help namespace), a functioning Search, image support, and overall better editing. Also, the home wiki will soon be part of the Android Alpha app.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Cleanup_of_/xowa/_root_directory">Cleanup of /xowa/ root directory</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      v2.8.3 now deploys much fewer files to the /xowa/ root directory. This was done primarily to avoid confusion for new users, as well as general deployment aesthetics. All other files have been moved to elsewhere in the /xowa/bin/xowa/ hierarchy. See the Change Log for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
      For upgrade users, you can ignore these old files in the /xowa/ root directory or clean them up manually. You can also update your app by regenerating the XOWA root directory.

      Unfortunately, I discovered this doesn't work perfectly for Serbian wikis. I'll fix this in a future release, but if you're a Serbian user, you will have to manually use explicit conversion links. For example: sr.wikipedia.org/sr-ec and sr.wikipedia.org/sr-el

      I discovered I accidentally disabled the build warning codes back in February. As a result, a number of minor Scribunto and Wikibase issues accumulated over the past few months. v2.8.1 resolves about 90% of these issues, though there are still a few more to go through.

      I delayed packages for another wiki due to all the parser issues (particularly the Wikibase ones). I'm going to resume with images for 2015-07 English Wikipedia as well as the still-delayed Ukraine, Persian and Bengali wikis.

      For v2.8.2, I'm going to make yet another attempt at converting the home wiki to a sqlite database. A new Android Alpha is still on the list as well.

      I'm skipping the release this week. I'm working on getting the multi-language dropdown for Chinese and Serbian wikis (and any other wikis with variant languages).

    <p>
      The old version of the Bookmarks page was a simple feature. It basically added bookmarks to the bottom of a wiki page. Unfortunately, it was part of the "home" wiki and used the old text database format. I needed to convert the home wiki for Android, but couldn't do it without breaking Bookmarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, v2.7.3 now has a new Bookmarks page. These entries get saved in the user database (D:\xowa\xowa.user.anonymous.sqlite3) . In addition, it supports HTTP Server mode. For more info, see <a href="/wiki/App/Bookmarks" id="xolnki_13" title="App/Bookmarks">App/Bookmarks</a>

      It turns out that MediaWiki allows pixel sizes in non-English numbers. For example [[File:A.png|۲۰۰px]] means 200px. Unfortunately, XOWA was interpreting this as no-image-size.

      The new Bookmarks page uses more Javascript libraries. This includes jquery-ui for dragging and resizing as well as notifyjs for notification messages. I updated the existing jquery script to the latest version and also changed some of the core xowa ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will probably become more of a future trend. Future GUI features will appear in Javascript rather than SWT. SWT / XULRunner is sometimes finicky cross-platform, and difficult to debug / reproduce. Meanwhile, GUI features implemented in Javascript can easily be used by the XOWA GUI as well as HTTP Server and Android.

In addition, English Wikipedia should be completing this week, so I'm hoping to get it out as soon as possible. I'll then go on to German, French and Arabic afterwards.

    <p>
      For v2.7.4, I'm going to move on to converting the home wiki to a sqlite database. Once that's done, I'll refresh the Android Alpha and try to add Bookmarks as well as bunch of other features.

    <p>
      First, many thanks again to Mattze96 for the great HTTP server. It's been running fine for a year and a half, and been easy to patch. However, new features were needed for the HTTP server including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Support for POST and other AJAX calls
      </li>
      <li>
        Server-side events
      </li>
      <li>
        More logging
      </li>
      <li>
        Unit testing capabilities
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Due to the changes involved, a rewrite of the core was easier and than trying to patch the existing piece. The new HTTP server engine is still a work in progress, but it is stable enough to introduce.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I fixed a bug with the Timeline javascript. For some reason, it failed in Firefox, but strangely not in XULRunner. Thanks to MDE for reporting it.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Large upgrade packages for 2.6.5</b>: Since I'm re-releasing XULRunner, the upgrade packages will be much larger than normal

      This was broken during the general database redesign in v2.4.3. XOWA was assuming that v1 image databases would have a format of "fsdb.atr.00.sqlite3". Instead some were "fsdb.atr#00.sqlite3". This only affects image databases from late 2013 and early 2014.

But all future releases will be at <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/</a> while discussions will be at <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/</a>.

    <p>
      As per <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/" rel="nofollow" class="external text">this blog post</a>, Wikimedia has started moving all traffic to https. Some of this seems to have been implemented during the past week. As a result, XOWA was failing in connections to the Wikimedia servers because it was using http.
    </p>
    <p>
      For v2.6.4, I updated the links to https. Image downloads (and api calls) now work.

    </h3>
    <p>
      This was a long time in coming. The last good build was back in April. The main problem was that the dump server had been offline for all of May. There were also some XOWA issues, and I had to patch the new code to handle v2 as well as v1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Image updates are currently a little confusing. There are currently 2 versions of image databases for English Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        v1: These are ".sqlite" databases in "/xowa/file/en.wikipedia.org/" directory. These were released in 2013-11.
      </li>
      <li>
        v2: These are ".xowa" databases in "/xowa/wiki/en.wikipedia.org/" directory. The databases are about 3 GB each. These were released in 2015-04
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      v1 is obsolete. I needed to make these changes for Android, as well as to simplify future deployments. I will still generate updates for it for the next year, but users are encourage to move over to a v2 series.

      I didn't get any of the planned changes done for this week, as both the table of contents and bookmarks were large items. I'm planning to work on them over the next few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, for v2.6.5, I'm planning to release new versions of SWT and XULRunner. This will bring XOWA a little up to date with recent Mozilla Firefox core changes, as well as take care of other defects (primarily, print page)
    </p>
    <p>
      For wikis, I'm going to upload the English Wikipedia HTML databases, and try to get German going as well.

      I'm trying something different with blog entries. I'm going to expand upon changes in the current release here, and give a preview of next week's release. I think the prior method was not offering much information. The new way takes more time to write, but hopefully it will be worth it.

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_images_sometimes_not_being_shown_for_v1_users">Fix for images sometimes not being shown for v1 users</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      v2.5.4 introduced a bug for users with v1 image databases (.sqlite). Here's a possible use case:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        User has English Wikipedia v1 image databases (.sqlite3)
      </li>
      <li>
        User upgraded to v2.5.4
      </li>
      <li>
        User imported the latest en.wikipedia.org
      </li>
      <li>
        User no longer sees any images
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The problem was that v2.5.4 automatically creates v2 image databases (.xowa) whenever a new wiki is imported. Furthermore, XOWA had logic that said if you had v2 and v1, use v2 first. As a result, the v1 databases were ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.6.2 now prefers v1 over v2. This should automatically fix anyone who encountered the problem above. Of course, if a v1 user moves to v2, then they would have to move / delete the v1 databases in order to see v2.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Mac OS X had two major issues:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Web browser would sometimes reset to blank when minimizing or switching tabs / windows</b>: This seems to have been fixed in a later XULRunner release (24+).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hover over doesn't work</b>: This appears to be a known Mozilla/XULRunner issue and may not be fixed for some time. See: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=246830" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=246830</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first item can be fixed by upgrading XULRunner, but I would also have to upgrade SWT as well. Unfortunately, I'm waiting on SWT to fix a bug before I can upgrade it: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=429739" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=429739</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, I decided to move Mac OS X to use WebKit. The initial results looked good.
    </p>
    <p>
      For anyone curious, this was done by adding "app.gui.browser_type = 'webkit';" to "bin/macosx_64/xowa/cfg/xowa_cfg_os_default.gfs". If you want to change back to XULRunner, change "xowa_cfg_os.gfs" to "app.gui.browser_type = 'mozilla';"
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm still including XULRunner in the Mac OS X app packages for now, though I may end up dropping them entirely in a future release.

      v2.5.4 introduced multiple highlights when using the find feature. Unfortunately, there were two bugs I couldn't fix for that release:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Multiple highlighting didn't work if the find-word occurred multiple times in the same paragraph
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiple highlighting didn't work for the first find after word wrap
      </li>

      Fixing the first was actually difficult, and I ended up rewriting the entire javascript function.

    <p>
      The wikidata dumps have been delayed for a while. The last good dump was <a href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/20150330/" rel="nofollow" class="external free">http://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/20150330/</a> In addition, Wikimedia had an outage in the dump service. See <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T98585" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T98585</a> Dumps have resumed, but it looks like wikidata is queued as one of the last ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I've been delaying the image databases until I got a new wikidata, I decided to do something else besides waiting. Wikimedia also generates JSON dumps and these have been running consistently every week for the past two months. See <a href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/" rel="nofollow" class="external free">http://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind, I wrote some very basic import code to build a wikidata wiki from the JSON dump. It's not perfect, but it allows me to make progress with the image databases.

      I've added a number of improvements for the XOWA droid alpha. The last release would not work on Android KitKat, and probably other versions as well. I've since tested on 2 other devices, and got them working. I've also added quite a bunch of other stability changes.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>&lt;q&gt;</b>: XOWA would show <b>&lt;q&gt;</b> instead of quotation marks (")
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>[[Category:]]</b>: XOWA would show blank [[Category:]] at the bottom of many pages. I fixed this by changing the regular expression, but it pretty much requires Java 1.7

    </ul>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Next_release">Next release</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      At this point, I'm focusing on uploading an English Wikipedia that can be used for XOWA droid. I'm generating an html dump build now and should have it uploaded in the next week or so. In addition, I'm also going to re-upload the English Wikipedia images as the current v2 batch won't work on Android (they have file sizes greater than 2 GB)
    </p>
    <p>
      Development-wise, I'm planning the following
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        More changes for XOWA droid including a Table of Contents and Search
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the existing bookmark system to be run from a sqlite database
      </li>
      <li>
        Update the home wiki to run from a sqlite database
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, for image databases, I'm only planning to upload the latest images for 2015-06-02 English Wikipedia. I'll be uploading v2 as well as v1 (.sqlite3)

    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.5.4.1 is a significant release. In brief, it involved a rewrite of the online file downloading system to use the same system as the offline version. It also includes instructions for building the image databases on <a href="/wiki/Dashboard/Image_databases" id="xolnki_25" title="Dashboard/Image databases">Dashboard/Image_databases</a> as well as an Android alpha.

    </p>
    <p>
      As a side-note, I've not generated image databases for a few weeks. This is due to the dumps being badly broken at <a href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html" rel="nofollow" class="external free">http://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html</a> See <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/xmldatadumps-l/2015-May/date.html" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/xmldatadumps-l/2015-May/date.html</a> and <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T98585" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T98585</a> .

    <p>
      v2.5.2.1 supports downloading the wiki logo from a new location. The change was serious enough to delay French and Arabic wikis for this week. I'm planning to upload them during the course of this week. I postponed the search change for punctuation as it looks like a significant change, and I didn't want to commit time to it just yet. I also did some work on the Android version.
    </p>

      For packages, the Korean wikis are uploading now and English Wikisource will upload tonight / tomorrow.

    <p>
      For v2.5.2, I'm planning on a search-related fix to handle punctuation (searching for "don't"). I'm also going to see what I need to release an Android version of Simple wiki to any interested user.

    <p>
      v2.4.4.1 introduces a multi-wiki search feature. The configuration is a bit difficult, but it should be flexible enough to handle most scenarios. See <a href="/wiki/Options/Search" id="xolnki_27" title="Options/Search">Options/Search</a>. I also made a few more improvements to the general Search behavior.

      v2.4.3.1 has some minor cleanup of items from Special:Search. I started working on multi-wiki search, but could not finish it. I also resolved a number of issues including a few around the HTTP server as well as general file retrieval.
    </p>
    <p>
      I generated images for English Wikipedia as well as the Simple, Polish and Greek wikis. Polish is uploading now, but the rest are done. I'll check the uploads tomorrow and update the archive.org pages if everything is fine.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      v2.4.2.1 improves performance for Special:Search. This took quite a bit of time as I had to rewrite most of the search code while also adding new features, such as background searching. There are still a few loose ends, but I believe the new version is much more usable than the old one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, neither English, Polish or Greek was done this week. I did download the English 2015-04-03 dump, and except for a few pages, the rest of the wiki is okay. Images should be available later this week.
    </p>
    <p>
      For v2.4.3, I want to clean up some of the loose ends on Special:Search, and also support searching over multiple wikis. I'll also upload Simple, English, Polish and Greek. If I have any leftover time, I'll go back to Android.

    <p>
      v2.4.1.1 introduces new major database layout changes. The main purposes were the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Generate single-database wikis for smaller wikis
      </li>
      <li>
        Generate detachable multi-database wikis for larger wikis, particularly English Wikipedia. Except for the <b>core</b> files, any other file can be deleted, and the wiki will still function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consolidate all databases in one directory, particularly the file databases. There will be no more files in <b>/xowa/file/</b>. Instead, everything will go to <b>/xowa/wiki/</b>.
      </li>

      So, I'm going to be skipping this week's release as well. The code is mostly done, but I had to rewrite a significant part last night, so I wanted to give it more time to burn in. Polish and Greek are still on hold, and they will be released after English.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm skipping this week's release. I'm rewriting more of the database code to generate a single-file wiki. I'm also doing the same for files to generate a single-file database. I'm hoping this will help simplify deployment in the future - particularly for Android. The code is stable, but I want a little while longer to review the database scheme. Aside from that, I haven't run into any bugs, so there wouldn't be much point to releasing a work-in-progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did post the latest English Wikipedia images at <a href="https://archive.org/details/Xowa_enwiki_latest" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/details/Xowa_enwiki_latest</a> I also posted Finnish wikis at <a href="https://archive.org/details/Xowa_fiwiki_latest" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/details/Xowa_fiwiki_latest</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.3.4 will include the new database code. I'm also planning on updating Polish and Greek.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.3.2.1 had some minor fixes. The most major fix was Wikisource not showing full content for non-English wikis. Unfortunately this was related to some of the infrastructural changes last week.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm uploading the Italian wikis now, but they will probably not be ready until the morning. I'm going to hold off on Finnish until next week. I did make more progress in Android, and now have MathJax working.
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.3.3.1 will have Finnish wikis as well as the latest English wiki update. I'm also working on a single-file XOWA database. Other than that, I'll continue ahead with Android.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.3.1.1 had no real fixes. The Dutch and Latin wikis were rebuilt without any isses, though Latin is still uploading. There were substantial infrastructural changes, though hopefully I won't run into the same release problems from last week. In addition, I finally got a very alpha version of images working on the Android.
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.3.2.1 will have a rebuild of the Italian and Finnish wikis. I'll continue ahead on Android and try to get a more stable version.

    <p>
      v2.2.4.3 was another interim release to fix offline file downloads not working.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.2.4.2 was an interim release to fix two issues:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        HTTP Web Server fails to load
      </li>
      <li>
        Online file downloads only work the first time
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Hopefully v2.3.1.1 should be more stable.

    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.2.4 included some major changes, the most significant of which was the Scribunto error when files were missing. There were also several involving wikidata.org. I made a lot of source code changes, and the version history will probably continue to be very busy for the next few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.2.4 also included a rebuild of the Russian wikis. Currently, archive.org is having issues so these will probably not be available until sometime Tuesday or even Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.3.1 will have a refresh of the Dutch and Latin wikis. I'm also working on getting an Android prototype of simplewiki with images.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      I'm skipping the release tonight. I've spent most of the week making a lot of changes to the file retrieval code, and I'd like another week to make sure things are stable. Also, this month's English Wikipedia release looks stable, so I have no real changes to post. I did upload updates for the English Wikipedia wiki as well as for Simple Wiki
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.2.4 will include the last of the file database changes. I'm also planning on updating a major wiki -- possibly Russian.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.2.2 saw a rebuild of the German wikis. I made a number of small parser changes, but otherwise the German wikis were clean. The German Wikipedia update is running late, so it won't be ready until sometime tomorrow. Aside from the German wikis, I also rewrote much of the database code for the file images.
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.2.3 will be a refresh of English Wiki. There probably won't be any images, as the Wikimedia dump service is behind, and the commonswiki won't be updated. For Android, I'll move on to building a single database that has both wikis and images in it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Release:_v2.2.1_(2015-02-01_14:35_Sun)">Release: v2.2.1 (2015-02-01 14:35 Sun)</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.2.1 had only a few changes. I generated the remaining English wikis and fixed a few minor related parser errors. In addition, I continued working on some more database code changes. Meanwhile, I decided to table some of the new Scribunto changes until later.
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.2.2 will include an update of the German wikis. I'm still making incremental progress on Android, and will hopefully complete most of the database rewrite.
