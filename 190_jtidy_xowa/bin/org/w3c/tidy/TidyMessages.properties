badaccess_frames=Pages designed using frames presents problems for\u000apeople who are either blind or using a browser that\u000adoesn't support frames. A frames-based page should always\u000ainclude an alternative layout inside a NOFRAMES element.
badaccess_missing_image_alt=The alt attribute should be used to give a short description\u000aof an image; longer descriptions should be given with the\u000alongdesc attribute which takes a URL linked to the description.\u000aThese measures are needed for people using non-graphical browsers.
badaccess_missing_image_map=Use client-side image maps in preference to server-side image\u000amaps as the latter are inaccessible to people using non-\u000agraphical browsers. In addition, client-side maps are easier\u000ato set up and provide immediate feedback to users.
badaccess_missing_link_alt=For hypertext links defined using a client-side image map, you\u000aneed to use the alt attribute to provide a textual description\u000aof the link for people using non-graphical browsers.
badaccess_missing_summary=The table summary attribute should be used to describe\u000athe table structure. It is very helpful for people using\u000anon-visual browsers. The scope and headers attributes for\u000atable cells are useful for specifying which headers apply\u000ato each table cell, enabling non-visual browsers to provide\u000aa meaningful context for each cell.
badaccess_summary=For further advice on how to make your pages accessible\u000asee "{0}". You may also want to try\u000a"http://www.cast.org/bobby/" which is a free Web-based\u000aservice for checking URLs for accessibility.
badchars_summary=Characters codes for the Microsoft Windows fonts in the range\u000a128 - 159 may not be recognized on other platforms. You are\u000ainstead recommended to use named entities, e.g. &trade; rather\u000athan Windows character code 153 (0x2122 in Unicode). Note that\u000aas of February 1998 few browsers support the new entities."
badform_summary=You may need to move one or both of the <form> and </form>\u000atags. HTML elements should be properly nested and form elements\u000aare no exception. For instance you should not place the <form>\u000ain one table cell and the </form> in another. If the <form> is\u000aplaced before a table, the </form> cannot be placed inside the\u000atable! Note that one form can't be nested inside another!
badlayout_using_body=You are recommended to use CSS to specify page and link colors
badlayout_using_font=You are recommended to use CSS to specify the font and\u000aproperties such as its size and color. This will reduce\u000athe size of HTML files and make them easier to maintain\u000acompared with using <FONT> elements.
badlayout_using_layer=The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Positioning mechanism\u000ais recommended in preference to the proprietary <LAYER>\u000aelement due to limited vendor support for LAYER.
badlayout_using_nobr=You are recommended to use CSS to control line wrapping.\u000aUse "white-space: nowrap" to inhibit wrapping in place\u000aof inserting <NOBR>...</NOBR> into the markup.
badlayout_using_spacer=You are recommended to use CSS for controlling white\u000aspace (e.g. for indentation, margins and line spacing).\u000aThe proprietary <SPACER> element has limited vendor support.

Some user agents\u000ause another algorithm to escape such URIs and some server-sided\u000ascripts depend on that. If you want to depend on that, you must\u000aescape the URI by your own.
