This is ustring, a pure-Lua library to handle UTF-8 strings.

It implements generally the same interface as the standard string library, with
the following differences:
* Most functions work on codepoints rather than bytes or characters. Yes, this
  means that even though "á" and "á" should appear identical and represent the
  same character, the former is one codepoint (U+00E1) while the latter is two
  (U+0061 U+0301).
* Added functions isutf8, byteoffset, codepoint, gcodepoint, toNFC, toNFD.
* No workalike for string.reverse is provided.

Contents:
* README - This file.
* ustring.lua - The main file for the library.
* string.lua - Extend the string metatable with methods from this library.
* upper.lua - Data table for ustring.upper.

* charsets.lua - Data tables for pattern matching functions.
* make-tables.php - Regenerate upper.lua and lower.lua using PHP's multibyte
  string library, and charsets.lua using PCRE.
