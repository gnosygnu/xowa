      v2.11.4 is a minor release. It has one fix affecting French Wikipedia pages, and another for the simple-mode Category system.

    <p>
      In v2.11.2, I added a fix to handle extraneous pre sections: see <a href="#Fix_for_extraneous_pre-sections_in_References" id="xolnki_10" title="">#Fix for extraneous pre-sections in References</a>. It turned out this fix was not correct, and caused pages in French Wikipedia to have large scrolling sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reverted the fix for v2.11.4. As it turned out, the issue with extraneous pre sections was handled by the underlying templates themselves.

      XOWA generates a simple Category system when it builds a wiki (this is called v1). If you want an authentic version of the Category system (this is called v2), you can always import it separately under [[Import offline]].
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple Category system looks like it broke some time ago during the general database redesign from .sqlite3 to .xowa. I fixed it for this release.

      I was able to do a basic HTML dump for simple wiki, but there are still a number of issues. These should be fixed this week, and hopefully I can try the new HTML dump system on English Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <p>
      For wikis, I'm going to work through the last of the old .sqlite3 wikis and go through Dutch (nl.*) and Latin wikis.

    <p>
      I fixed the one minor Wikibase issue, but am deferring a few other possible issues till later. I'm still chugging away on the HTML dump. My aim is to get a simple wiki dump for the next release.
    </p>
    <p>
      I generated the English Wiki dump but there were only about 3 thousand new images, and I didn't feel that it merited an update. For wikis, I'm going to update French, and then go through as many as I can of Lithuanian, Limburgish, Estonian, Latvian and Nynorsk.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Release:_v2.11.2.1_.282015-11-08_22:00_Sun.29">Release: v2.11.2.1 (2015-11-08 22:00 Sun)</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.11.2 is a significant release. It addresses minor, but noticeable issues with gallery sections, location maps, and references. It also has some Wikibase fixes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_Gallery_rendering_vertically_instead_of_horizontally">Fix for Gallery rendering vertically instead of horizontally</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Wikimedia added a change a few weeks ago to force &lt;gallery&gt; tags to use a css. See <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T110709" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T110709</a> This resulted in galleries being shown vertically, instead of horizontally.
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.11.2 now includes this css.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_Location_maps_not_working_on_non-English_wikis">Fix for Location maps not working on non-English wikis</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This has been a bug for a few months, but I had misdiagnosed it as bad Module code. Basically, non-English wikis would copy-paste the same Module:Location_map code in to their wikis. This failed to work in XOWA, because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Module code has a hard-coded reference to <code>Template</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        XOWA actually generates the non-English name for Template for the wiki. For Croatian Wikipedia, this is <code>Šablon</code> not <code>Template</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This basically broke location maps in non-English wikis. I should have caught this earlier, but the first few I looked at were all bad usages (no location coordinates passed).
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.11.2 now uses the canonical name just like MediaWiki.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_extraneous_pre-sections_in_References">Fix for extraneous pre-sections in References</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think this is also a recent bug, but I can't track down the actual cause. MediaWiki has inconsistent logic for trimming whitespace around template and link arguments. The one at issue was a piece of code like <code>{{TemplateName| B\n }}</code>. On my local version of MediaWiki (1.25.2), it doesn't trim the <code>"\n "</code> after the B and creates a &lt;pre&gt; section. However, on Wikipedia, it does trim the whitespace and does not create a &lt;pre&gt; section.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this behavior changed recently, but couldn't find the actual line of code in MediaWiki. For now, XOWA will automatically trim end whitespace for all template arguments. In my opinion this is more intuitive behavior anyway.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_Wikibase_fixes">Minor Wikibase fixes</span>

    <p>
      These are a handful of signficant fixes that only affect some several dozen pages. They are in brief:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        in Lua code, entity.formatPropertyValues('P123') would not work. Note that entity.formatPropertyValues('property_name') did work
      </li>
      <li>
        Lua code expects a "datatype" property on entity and a value of "globe-coordinate".
      </li>
      <li>
        Lua code required actual numbers for quantity ("99"), not the literal Wikidata value ("+99")
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_fixes_for_Redirect">Minor fixes for Redirect</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      These are two minor items worth more explanation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Redirects would not work if they had an argument. For example, #REDIRECT [[Target_page|link=collapsed]]
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on "Redirected from" links at the top of the page would not work. For example, try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK</a> and click on "Redirected from UK"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_JTidy_fix_to_always_enclose_body_text">Minor JTidy fix to always enclose body text</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This was actually not working from the start. Basically tidy needs to take something like ...
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;a&lt;/div&gt;a1&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;b&lt;/div&gt;b1
</pre>
    <p>
      ... and add some &lt;p&gt; tags to produce ...

<pre>
&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;a&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;a1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;b&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;b1&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
      This has a noticeable visual effect for some wikis (Croatian Wiktionary) which have HTML like the above.
    </p>
    <p>
      I modified the jtidy_xowa.jar to handle this behavior.

      v2.10.2 is a major release. It has a critical fix for the 2015-10 English Wikipedia dump. It also features better functionality for Chinese / Serbian language wikis. Finally, it also has some significant under-the-hood changes

    <p>
      XOWA was showing broken references on 2.6 millions pages for the 2015-10 English Wikipedia dump. This was due to some recent changes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module:Citation/CS1">Module:Citation/CS1</a>. Specifically, the number of local variables in the citation0 function was greater than the default 200 limit for Luaj.

      I recompiled a new version of luaj_xowa.jar to fix this issue.

      This item basically involves the following changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Serbian languages now have language dropdowns. For example, sr.wikipedia.org now allows you to switch between Cyrillic and Latin variants
      </li>
      <li>
        Chinese and Serbian wikis now fully implement the "-{}-" syntax. This includes some significant functions like recursive conversion, word-interchangeability, and adhoc rule-definition. See: <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Writing_systems/Syntax">https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Writing_systems/Syntax</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'm really hoping that the new functionality matches MediaWiki. If you're a Chinese / Serbian user, please take a moment to spot-check a few pages and let me know if there is anything amiss.

      MediaWiki recently changed the &lt;syntaxhighlight&gt; extension away from geshi to Pygments. In the process, it looks like they changed a few of the general parsing rules as well. v2.10.4 has better support for these blocks, though actual syntax coloring is still some time away.

      I didn't have time to generate any wikis this week. I'm going to do English, Serbian and one of Malay, Hebrew, Bulgarian for v2.10.2
    </p>
    <p>
      For code, I'm going to start working on an article update function (update the offline article with the latest version from online Wikipedia).
    </p>

    <h2>
      <span class='mw-headline' id='Release:_NONE_.282015-10-04_22:00_Sun.29'>Release: NONE (2015-10-04 22:00 Sun)</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I'm skipping the release this week. I ran into some issues with Chinese / Serbian translations, though I think I'm pretty close to being done. In addition, I have some other significant changes in queue which I didn't want to introduce for a "first-week-of-the-month" release.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want a recent stable release, use <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/tag/v2.9.4.1" class="external text" rel="nofollow">v2.9.4.1</a>. I'll keep that release up for a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, next week's v2.10.2 will have more changes. I'll also resume generating wikis from the list below.
